    Given the elevator simulator and API are online                   # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:29
    When I send a data packet without the "position" field to the API # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:81
    Then the API should return a 400 error                            # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:88

  Scenario: Store and Forward (Connection Resilience)  # features/elevator.feature:45
    Given the elevator simulator and API are online    # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:29
    Given that the API connection is lost              # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:93
    When the elevator generates data for a few seconds # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:98
    And the API connection is restored                 # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:102
 * Serving Flask app 'mock_api'
 * Debug mode: on
    Then the API should have received the stored data  # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:107
