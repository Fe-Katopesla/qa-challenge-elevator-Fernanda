[TEST LOG] Verified: The system correctly rejected the invalid floor command.

  Scenario: Activate and Deactivate maintenance mode  # features/elevator.feature:29
    Given the elevator simulator and API are online   # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:29
    When I send the "MAINTENANCE_ON" command          # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:40
[ELEVATOR] Maintenance Mode ACTIVATED
    Then the elevator should enter maintenance mode   # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:63
    When I send the "MAINTENANCE_OFF" command         # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:40
[ELEVATOR] Maintenance Mode DEACTIVATED
    Then the elevator should exit maintenance mode    # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:68

  Scenario: Verify continuous data reception                                                # features/elevator.feature:36

    Then the cloud should periodically receive "position", "weight", and "door_status" data # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:74
All required fields received successfully.

  Scenario: Send invalid payload to the API                           # features/elevator.feature:40
    Given the elevator simulator and API are online                   # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:29
    When I send a data packet without the "position" field to the API # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:84
    Then the API should return a 400 error                            # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:91

  Scenario: Store and Forward (Connection Resilience)  # features/elevator.feature:45
    Given the elevator simulator and API are online    # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:29
    Given that the API connection is lost              # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:96
    When the elevator generates data for a few seconds # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:101
    And the API connection is restored                 # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:105
 * Serving Flask app 'mock_api'
 * Debug mode: on
    Then the API should have received the stored data  # features/steps/elevator_steps.py:110
